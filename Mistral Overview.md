# Overview

Mistral AI is an artificial intelligence startup that makes open source large language models (LLMs). Based in Paris, France, and founded by former researchers at Google DeepMind and Meta, Mistral is known for its open, portable, customizable and cost-effective models that require fewer computational resources than other popular LLMs. All of Mistral AI's LLMs are foundation models, which means they can be fine-tuned and used in a wide-range of natural language processing tasks.
