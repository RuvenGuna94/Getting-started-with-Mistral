# Getting Started with Mistral

Welcome to the repository for the course **Getting Started with Mistral** by DeepLearning.AI.

## About the Course

In this course, you’ll access Mistral AI’s collection of open-source and commercial models, including the **Mixtral 8x7B** model and the latest **Mixtral 8x22B**. You’ll learn about selecting the right model for your use case and get hands-on with features like effective prompting techniques, function calling, JSON mode, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Model Selection**
   - Access and prompt Mistral models via API calls.
   - Decide on the complexity of tasks:
     - **Simple**: Classification
     - **Medium**: Email writing
     - **Advanced**: Coding
   - Consider speed requirements to choose the appropriate model.

2. **Function Calling**
   - Learn to use Mistral’s native function calling.
   - Enable LLMs to perform tasks better suited for traditional code, such as querying databases for numerical data.
   
3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Build a basic RAG system from scratch with similarity search.
   - Properly chunk data, create embeddings, and implement RAG as a function in your chat system.

4. **Interactive Chat Interface**
   - Build a chat interface to interact with Mistral models.
   - Ask questions about a document you upload.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped to:
- Effectively leverage Mistral AI’s open-source and commercial models.
- Build scalable and efficient systems for various use cases.
- Implement advanced techniques like RAG and function calling.
